                        Yes, you can use any of the art submitted to this site. Even in commercial projects. Just be sure to adhere to the license terms.
                        Artists often indicate how they would like to be credited in the "Copyright/Attribution Notice:" section of the submission. You can find
                        this between the submission's description and the list of downloadable files. If no Copyright/Attribution Notice instructions are given,
                        a good way to credit an author for any asset is to put the following text in your game's credits file and on your game's credits screen:
                    </p>
                    <br />

                        Yes, but only under specific circumstances. To upload content created by someone other than yourself, you must first make absolutely
                        certain that the content has been released under one of the allowed licenses. Furthermore, you must attribute their work to them in the
                        Author field. Failing to do so is plagiarism, and will result in the work being removed along with a possible suspension of your
                        account. Finally, regardless of the license the art is released under, if the artist has specifically requested that their work not be
                        distributed from other websites, Open Game Art honors those requests and will not accept submissions of their art.

                    <p>
                        In the case of Public Domain (or CC0) art that you didn't create yourself, we appreciate if you include a link back to the source of the
                        content. We make an effort to verify that PD content is actually in the public domain before we approve it for the archive, and it
                        speeds things up a lot if we know where you got it. If you're the author of the work and you want to remain anonymous, just mention that
                        in the description.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, some licensed works may have specific attribution requirements that go above and beyond just listing the author of the work. If
                        so, please list those requirements in the description.

                        even if it's not required by the license. If this information isn't readily available and it's not required, don't worry about it.

Can you take it down?",answer:`<p>Yes, but please keep in mind that if you released your content under any Creative Commons license that allows derivative works, and the work displays shows the correct license and is attributed to you, then it is legal for that content to be here. If the attribution or license are incorrect, we would prefer to correct them rather than take the content down. However, we will remove all art at the author's request regardless of license, provided we can reasonably verify that you're the real author.</p>

                        More specifically, the licenses that can be selected on this site are meant to be GPL-compatible. Thus, if you're releasing your project
                        under the GPL, it is safe to use any and all of the art on this site. Note that there is a common misconception with using CC-licensed
                        media with GPLed code, which I address here.

                    <p>
                        If you are releasing your project under some other Free and/or Open Source license (or not releasing your source code at all), it's
                        likely that there could be licensing conflicts depending on what license the art is released under. It is your responsibilityto verify
                        the compatibility of the art license with the license you are using.

                        That depends on what you mean by "compatible". They are incompatible in the sense that you can't take someone else's CC-BY or CC-BY-SA
                        content and slap the GPL on them, and you can't write code licensed under one of those licenses and mingle it with GPLed code. However,
                        for the intent of creating and distributing games, the Free Software Foundation has clarified that the game code and game media are
                        separate entities and do not need to be released under the same license, provided those licenses allow you to copy and redistribute the
                        work for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. Here's what the FSF has to say about this:

                            Data that has an aesthetic purpose, rather than a functional one, may be included in a free system distribution as long as its
                            license gives you permission to copy and redistribute, both for commercial and non-commercial purposes. For example, there are some
                            game engines that have been released under the GNU GPL, and have accompanying game information -- a world map, game graphics, and so
                            on -- released under such a verbatim distribution license. This kind of data can be part of a free system distribution.

                    <p>
                       Apple's App Store in particular has been found to have usage terms that conflict
                       with the terms of the GNU GPL, the GNU LGPL, CC-BY-SA, and CC-BY. However, many
                       artists releasing works under these licences are fine with their works being used
                       in the app store if you get their permission.

                    <p>
                       Note that OpenGameArt.org cannot grant you this permission, you must ask the artist directly.
                       If the art you want to use is a derivative work of another piece of art, or is by multiple authors,
                       you must get permission from all of the authors.

                       Short answer: yes.
                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p>
                       The long answer is that, even if OGA explicitly paid you money to create art, we do not (nor will we ever)
                       take possession of the copyright to that art.  This means that you can still license your artwork however
                       you want, to whomever you want.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Let's say, for example, that you create a set of game graphics and release them here on OGA under the CC-BY-SA license.
                       If someone would like to use and alter your art without sharing it, they are free to contact you and obtain a license
                       to do so.  You are free to charge them for this license.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Now, there are a couple of catches.  While we will take down any artwork of yours that you request we take down
                       (provided you can provide reasonable proof that you're the author of that work, and that we didn't conpensate you for it),
                       that work is already perpetually licensed CC-BY-SA, and anyone who has already downloaded it has the right to continue using
                       and distributing it under that same license.  They do not, however, have the right to license your work to third parties under
                       different terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Furthermore, if you have plans to sell your contributed art to third parties, it is highly recommended that you select either CC-BY-SA,
                       the GPL, or some combination of the two, as there is little motivation for a commercial interest to pay you for the privilege of using
                       your art if you've already granted that privilege without requiring them to share.
                    </p>`,buttons:[]},{question:"I'm a commercial artist. Can I use OpenGameArt.org to advertise my paid work?",answer:`<p>
                       Absolutely, in fact several artists are already doing precisely that.  All you need to do is pick a work of yours
                       that you think people would be interested in, and submit it to OGA under any of the license choices that we offer.
                       When you submit your art, be sure to include a link back to your web page or portfolio in the submission.  You may also
                       want to mention in the description that you work on commission.  If you release your art under CC-BY or CC-BY-SA, you can
                       mention in the description that people should link back to your website when they attribute you for your work.

                      You must follow only one of the licenses. However, when you re-distribute/edit, you are encouraged to include/use all of the licenses, so the license spectrum (and thus sum of people/projects who can use the art) doesn't shrink.

                    obligation to do so, because the license you obtained it under is irrevocable.  In practice, very few (if any) artists on OGA ever remove
                    licensing options, although occasionally some add more.

                    <p>
                     Unfortunately, a lot of texture and sample websites have "not for commercial use" or other odd restrctions that made their content completely incompatible with the licenses we have here.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                     Please note that we would still love for you to submit your 3D model or song.  Please remove the textures or samples that you can't track down, and, if possible, replace them with something
                     that you can verify is under a free license.  If you know where to find the person who made the textures or samples, try contacting them first, as many people are open to changing the license on
                     their work.
                    </p>
                           <br />
                    <p>
                     Worst case scenario, if you can't find any replacement textures, just submit the model with no texture.  In the case of music, replace the sample with a placeholder and upload a midi file along with it so that people can fill it in later.

                    <p>
                     There are plenty of other sites out there, but they aren't necessarily conducive to finding good game art that
                     can be used legally in open source games. To be a good source for this kind of content, a site should be:

                    <br />
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">

                        Some art sites serve as places where artists can post their work and get critiques. While some of these artists are willing to license
                        their work out in a way that's compatible with free/open source software, it can be very difficult to find art that's appropriately
                        licensed.

                        Other sites provide sprites for use, but they allow people to contribute sprites that have been "ripped" from games, and are therefore

                      If you've ever browsed Free/Open Source game sites (such as The Linux Game Tome, you'll notice that a fairly significant number of the games available suffer from what's lovingly referred to
                      as 'programmer art'. There are, of course, some notable exceptions to this, but it's clear that, for an open source game to produce good art, it has to become large and popular enough to attract artists.

                     Unfortunately, many fun and well-designed games never reach this point and are thus stuck with placeholder art, which ultimately detracts from their appeal and popularity. Furthermore,
                     it's not unheard of for open source projects to rip their placeholder art from commercial games, which is illegal and could conceivably result in a lawsuit.
